# Pharmacy Operations Backend (Django)

## Overview
This project is a Django-based backend system designed to manage internal pharmacy operations.
It mirrors real-world enterprise systems used by large pharmacy chains for inventory and order management.

The system is **admin-driven**, focuses on **data integrity**, and exposes **secure APIs** for internal or app-based consumption.
There is no frontend UI by design.
